My name is Nikitas Chatzis and I am a first year PhD candidate at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/home),
advised by [prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://kalo-ai.github.io/).
I do research in Computer Graphics, Generative AI and Computer Vision.

I previously graduated with an MSc. in Data Science and Machine Learning from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en),
where I worked with [prof. Symeon Papavassiliou](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/personalPage/cfb2b5ae-8945-4603-a80e-0362491a5010).
Before that I received my BSc. in Computer Science from [University of Piraeus](https://cs.unipi.gr/en/),
where I did my bachelor's thesis with [prof. Aggelos Pikrakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hPZSYsgAAAAJ&hl=en).
During my undergraduate studies, I also interned at [NCSR "Demokritos"](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/el/).
