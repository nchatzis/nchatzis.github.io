My name is Nikitas Chatzis and I am a researcher at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/home),
working with [prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://kalo-ai.github.io/).
My research is centered around Generative AI for Computer Graphics and Computer Vision.

I recently graduated with an MSc. in Data Science and Machine Learning from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en),
where I worked with [prof. Symeon Papavassiliou](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/76).
Before that I received my BSc. in Computer Science from [University of Piraeus](https://cs.unipi.gr/en/),
where I did my bachelor's thesis with [prof. Aggelos Pikrakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hPZSYsgAAAAJ&hl=en).
During my undergraduate studies, I also interned at [NSCR "Demokritos"](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/el/).

CV is available upon request.
